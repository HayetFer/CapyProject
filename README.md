# CapyProject

Since this was my second project with django, I tried to add features such as login, a weather app or a diary feature, wich keeps track of all entries. 
This was a challenge, because I was self taught and didn't code much before. 
But before everything, this is a silly hommage to my favorite animals, Capybaras.
